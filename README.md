Project implemented during AGH Object-Oriented Programming course.
Each day animals can move, eat, reproduce or die. You can choose size of the grid, energy levels and you can also use "magic mode" - option that makes simulation longer by adding 5 more animals.
In the middle of the world you can find jungle where animals can find more plants and gain their energy back. You can also check the most common genotype created while reproducing and informatiions about particular animal.
You can find more information here.
